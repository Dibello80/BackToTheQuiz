# BackToTheQuiz

This application is a Quiz app with a timer as tribute to Back To The Future movie.
When the "Start Quiz" button is clicked the theme song starts and window will pop up explaing to the user the main rules of the quiz (5 rules).
In this rules window we have two buttons (Exit Quiz and Continue).
if "Exit Quiz" button is clicked the app will go back to the starting point and the music will stop instead if the "Continue" button is cliked the the Quiz game starts.
When the Quiz starts you will have 60 seconds to answer a set of 5 questions. Each question has 4 different answers and only one is correct.
After you answer a question you must click the "Next" button to go to the next question.  
Once you select your answer it can't be undone and if the answer is correct the box will turn green. 
In the situation where the answer is wrong then the box will turn red, the app will also show you the correct answer that will turn green and you will also loose 6 seconds from the countdown timer.
You can't exit from the Quiz while you're playing and you will get 1 point for each correct answer.
When times is out or i you have answered all five questions the quiz will stop and you will have a new window with your score result.
In the score window you have three buttons with three diffent options, "Replay", "Quit" or "Score".
"Replay" button cliked to play another round, "Quit" to go back to the main page and if you click "Score" you can save your result to the localstorage.
